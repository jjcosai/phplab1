    <h2>Blockchain</h2>
    <p>Blockchain is the technology the underpins digital currency (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and the like). 
        The tech allows digital information to be distributed, but not copied. That means each individual piece of 
        data can only have one owner.
        <br><br>
Imagine two entities (e.g. banks) that need to update their own user account balances when there is a request to 
transfer money from one customer to another. They need to spend a tremendous (and costly) amount of 
time and effort for coordination, synchronization, messaging and checking to ensure that each transaction 
happens exactly as it should. Typically, the money being transferred is held by the originator until it 
can be confirmed that it was received by the recipient. With the blockchain, a single ledger of transaction 
entries that both parties have access to can simplify the coordination and validation efforts because there 
is always a single version of records, not two disparate databases.

    <h2>Autonomous Things</h2>
    <p>Autonomous things, such as robots, drones and autonomous vehicles, go beyond the automation provided by
        rigid programming models and exploit AI to deliver advanced behaviours that interact more naturally 
        with their surroundings and with people 
        <br><br>
Autonomous vehicles are constantly collecting data from their environment; such as the road conditions, 
potential hazards, pedestrians, surrounding vehicles and even storing the routes and roads themselves. 
In order for these vehicles to become safer they rely on a vast amounts of software and the collection of vast 
amounts of data to train the artificial intelligence to ensure the safety of their passengers without humans 
having to intervene. I have read a stat that says these vehicles exchange around 15,000 pieces of data within a 
tenth of a second, this is a figure that could rise to 200,000 pieces of data by 2020.

    <h2>Immersive Experiences</h2>
    <p>Immersive experiences are constructed environments that use sensory stimulation to ‘feel real’. 
        Immersive experiences aren’t always digital, but immersive technologies are great experiential amplifiers.
        Like science fiction come to life, Virtual Reality (VR) accesses digital worlds you ‘step’ into, Augmented Reality
        (AR) creates digital layers over the top of the real world, and Mixed Reality (MR) is a combination of the two.
        <br> <br>
Video Games make great use of Immersive experiences, especially Virtual Reality, with many options for “headsets” as 
the Oculus Rift, the Oculus Go, the HTC Vive and many more to be used to play games on computers or Consoles such as 
PlayStation (PSVR). Video Games also make use of Augmented Reality on mobile games, such as the phenomenon that is 
Pokémon Go. Augmented reality is also used outside of the video game world, as Snapchat use it for their filters, 
but IKEA had the ingenious idea to allow customers to see if the product would fit in the area they wanted, and 
whether or not they thought the product suited the area.
